<h2 id="about">üßê About</h2>

This is one of my first Python projects, hope you get the most out of it :)

I used it to sell Fitness and Christian quotes on Fiverr for a while.


<h2 id="working">üí≠ How it works</h2>

<h4>#1 Content</h4>
After choosing the topics I wanted, I got a list of quotes and a stock of 50+ background images - both related to the picked topic.

<h4>#2 Prepping</h4>

After getting enough images, I run those 2 functions:

helper.cut_images_new(): to crop the images to the desired dimensions.

helper.darken_images(): to darken the images so the text looks better.

<h4>#3 Editing</h4>
The script works by taking a background image from '/sources/images/{topic}' and a quote from the .txt file, and combining them into 1 photo.

I am using **PILLOW** to generate the text in different fonts and combine it with the background image.

All the images are copyright-free from stock footage websites, and the fonts are copyright-free as well.

<h2 id="how_to">üèÅ How to run</h2>

Follow the instructions given below to get this script up and running on your device.

1. Download this repository as zip file / using git.
2. Open the folder.
3. Make sure all the required modules are installed. (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Open main.py
5. set the number of posts you want, your logo, and choose a topic (It can be one of the available topics, or you can add another one, how to is explained here)
```python
TOPIC = "fitness"
SHOW_AUTHOR = True
CUSTOMER_NAME = "your_name"
NUM_OF_POSTS = 35
```
6. RUN!
7. And that's it! In about 5 seconds, you will have 100+ generated images!
8. You can find your images in the `generated/your_name/` directory.

<h2 id="topics">üìã Available Topics</h2>

1. Christian
2. Fitness

To create a new topic, please follow these steps:

1. Create a {topic}.txt file inside /sources/text_data
2. Run "helper.create_new_topic_dirs(TOPIC, project_dir)" to auto create all the directories needed
3. Add images to /sources/images/{topic}
4. Run "helper.cut_images_new(images_folder, images_folder_cropped)" to crop the images to 1080 X 1350
(you can change the dimension inside the function)
5. Run "helper.darken_images(images_folder_cropped, images_folder_cropped_darken)" if you want to make the images darker
(it makes the text look better)

ANS THAT'S IT! :)
